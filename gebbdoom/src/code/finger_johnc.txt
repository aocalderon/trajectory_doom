This is my daily work ...

When I accomplish something, I write a * line that day.

Whenever a bug / missing feature is mentioned during the 
day and I don't fix it, I make a note of it. Some things 
get noted many times before they get fixed.

Occasionally I go back through the old notes and mark 
with a + the things I have since fixed.
