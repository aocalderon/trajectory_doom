When our last hit, WOLFENSTEIN 3D was released the public responded with an almost immediate  deluge of home-brewed utilities; map editors, sound editors,  trainers, etc.  All without any help on file formats or game layout from Id Software.  DOOM will be release as an OPEN GAME. We will provide file formats and technical notes for anyone who wants them.   People will be able to easily write and share anything from their own map editors to  communications and network drivers.}{Early 1993 Press Release}

Quote:

DOOM is simply an all-time great game. A big factor in its success
and durability is the plethora of user-created add-ons. id Software
tacitly encouraged them by including the -FILE parameter, and by having
a data format that is both straightforward and easy to understand.
DOOM is basically two files, DOOM.EXE and DOOM.WAD. DOOM.EXE is the
"engine" which does the display and controls the game, and DOOM.WAD has
ALL of the graphics, sound, and map/level data that the engine uses.
The -FILE parameter allows small or large external "WAD" files to be
incorporated, changing any number of those graphics, sounds, and maps.
