\section{Summary}

Even though the Floating Point Unit performance was drastically improved compared to the previous generation (i387), it was still a far cry of what the ALU could deliver with performances up to 20x slower. As a result, video games of the 90s did not have the luxury to use floating point arithmetics. To play \doom, a 486-SX or a 486-DX were exactly the same thing.\\
