\section{ShadowCaster}
\label{label_shadowcaster}
Developed by Raven with a licensed technology from id software. John Carmack wrote the ShadowCaster 3D engine during his technology research after id Software completed Wolfenstein 3D. The engine features diminished lighting, texture mapped floors and ceilings, walls with variable heights and sloped floors. The map are still made of blocks with orthogonal walls. The engine was "about half as fast as that of Wolfenstein" but fit the exploration of ShadowCaster rather than the fast paced action of Doom.
